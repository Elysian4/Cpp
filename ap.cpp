/*Problem statement 

An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of sequence is constantAn arithmetic progression should have at least 3 numbers

given a sorted integer array arr and its length I as inputYou are required to find the length of the longest arithmetic progression in the sorted array arr and print the same.

Note:

Arithmetic progression need not be contiguous in the array

Print 0, if array arr doesn't contain the arithmetic progression

Print -1, if array arr is empty.

Input Format:

Each test case consists of two lines of input,

The first line contains an integer, i.e. I

The second line contains numbers of integers separated by space, l.eelements of arr.

Input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate

Output Format:

Print the length of the longest arithmetic progression in the sorted array arr.

The output will be matched to the candidate's output printed on the STDOUT

Constraints: .0<< 104

âš« 0 < value of each element of arr < 109

Example:

Input:

6 1 7 10 15 27 29

Output:

3

Explanation:

The longest arithmetic progression in arr is {1, 15, 29} the length of which is 3, hence the output is 3.

Sample input

6
